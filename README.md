## 🧩 Code Explanation

The website is structured using semantic HTML elements such as header, section, and footer. The header contains the website logo and navigation links for smooth navigation between sections.

The hero section uses a full-screen background image with a dark overlay and centered text to attract users. CSS Flexbox and Grid are used to align content and create responsive layouts for services, packages, and gallery sections.

Internal CSS is used to define colors, fonts, spacing, hover effects, and media queries. A media query ensures the website adapts properly to smaller screen sizes like mobile devices.

The services section highlights key offerings, the packages section displays popular travel packages with images and prices, and the gallery section showcases travel destinations visually. The contact section displays essential contact details in a highlighted layout, and the footer includes copyright information.

Overall, this project demonstrates a clean, responsive, and modern travel agency website using only HTML and CSS.
